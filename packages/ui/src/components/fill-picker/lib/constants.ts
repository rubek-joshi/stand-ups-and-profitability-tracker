/**
 * Edge treatment for sample chips — swatches, gradient presets, the preview.
 *
 * These used to carry `border border-border`, which is wrong for a color
 * sample in two ways: an outer border steals a pixel from the color itself,
 * and because it paints a fixed opaque grey *outside* the sample it reads as
 * a halo — glaring around a dark chip on a light surface, and vanishing
 * entirely around a dark chip on a dark surface, which is exactly backwards
 * from where an edge is needed.
 *
 * Instead draw a translucent hairline *inside* the chip, as an `::after`
 * overlay so it sits above whatever fills the tile (the swatch's color span,
 * the preview's stacked fg/bg layers). Being translucent, it disappears into
 * a saturated or dark color — which is correct, since those already separate
 * from the surface — and only asserts itself on the pale samples that would
 * otherwise dissolve into it. The tone flips per theme so a near-white chip
 * stays defined on a light surface and a near-black chip on a dark one.
 *
 * Apply to a `relative` element; the chip's own `rounded-*` is inherited.
